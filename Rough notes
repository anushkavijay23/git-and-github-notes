*Git and GitHub* are version control systems.
It addresses the problem of *sharing code* created by different developers for a common project.
Another problem it solves is *versioning*, like if you want to go back to a version of the code from 50 days ago.
*Git* is a distributed version control system, and it is an *open-source* tool.
*What is a fork?* It is a copy of the original repository.
Everything in Git is tracked as *objects* (blobs, trees, commits).
Using *hooks*, we can prevent mistakes like exposing API tokens or sensitive data.
*Git status* shows the current state of the repository, including any untracked or modified files.
*Git add <filename>* tracks a specific file or files, preparing them for commit.
*Git diff* shows exactly what changes have been made to the code (line-by-line changes).
